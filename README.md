Each folder contains, optionally
- One README.md article about this topic. This article, optionally, starts with a table with key-value pairs. A "Tag" can be used to show the alternative names of this topic if the folder name is different from the actual topic name (case insensitive).
- Zero or more source code files named folder-name.lang. For example, binary-search.py
