Algorithms in Python, frequently used in daily coding projects and asked during job interviews.

Each folder contains information about one algorithm, specifically:

- One README.md file about this algorithm. This article, optionally, starts with a table with key-value pairs. A "Tag" can be used to show the alternative names of this topic if the folder name is different from the actual topic name (case insensitive).
- One or more \*.py files containing implementations of this algorithm in Python.
- One or more \*-test.py files containing unit tests.
