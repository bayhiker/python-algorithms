Three lions and three wildebeests are running away from a fire,
but a river is in front of them with only one raft that holds
at most two animals and needs at least one animal to operate the
raft back and forth. At no time can more lions be left alone with
less wildebeests, otherwise the lions will eat the wildebeests.
Note that this also includes to animals being offloaded from boats.

Figure out a way for all animals to safely cross the river only
with this single raft.
