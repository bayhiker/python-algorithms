        # 1. Queries are offline and can be sorted, sort queries by limit_j non-increasing
        # 2. Sort edge_list by dis_i
        # 3. One by one, filter edge_list by sorted limit_j, create and update union-find sets
        #    with newly-enabled edges, check if p_j and q_j have the same parent
